### Welcome to MinoriTeas!
This is a weekly meeting intended to help underrepresented students and faculty within computing find community at the University of Michigan, hosted by [Chad Jenkins](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ocj/). We welcome students from any computing discipline (not just computer science!), including fields like mechanichal engineering, robotics, and aerospace engineering. 

We meet weekly on Tuessday in the [Bob and Better Beyster Building](https://goo.gl/maps/XG6JvjCKCUYCFmCg8) (BBB) in room 4941  from 4:30pm-6:30pm. Aside from tea, we also typically offer food (either Pizza or Sandwhiches), so please join us for a meal!

We rarely have a set agenda. Generally, we simply seek good discussion :)

- We encourage faculty to come, engage with students, and to learn about how their experience can be improved
- We encourage students to share their research and passions (in research, coursework, and otherwise) with each other

Periodically we host guest faculty in effort to improve communication and understanding between underrepresented students and faculty. Please email Chad @ <a href="mailto:socj@umich.edu" >ocj@umich.edu</a> if you are interested in participating.

We hope to see you at our next meeting!

### Previous Guest Faculty:
 - Emily Provost (02/25/20). Her research relates to emotion recognition and its use in assistive technologies (such as for the detection of bipolar disorder).  She is currently a member of the CSE Executive Committee, which makes many important decisions for the Division. Prof. Mower-Provost was interested in hearing from students about how CSE can improve their experience and sense of inclusion.

 - Sindhu Kitty (02/17/20). She teaches courses such as machine learning (EECS 445). As a grad student at Michigan, she was also a GSI for discrete math (EECS 203). Prof. Kutty was interested in engaging and learning more about the challenges of diversity in CSE. She had interesting survey results about diversity in her courses.

- Juan Gilbet (01/22/19). He is a recently named ACM Fellow. He is in the leadership of the [iAAMCS Institute](iaamcs.org), run by my good colleague Prof. Monica Anderson at Alabama, for broadening participation in the computing profession.
